## Task 1: Advanced Structure: Implement a novel version of heap
#
### **Background Information:**

**Your task is to implement one of the proposed data structures: a slightly modified heap. The heap must satisfy the heap property, but rather than a traditional binary heap, each parent node in this heap will have 2^x children.** Since the goal is to benchmark the most common operations on the data structure, you will only be responsible for implementing two methods - insert, and pop max. Think carefully about what parts of the heap need to change, and how those changes will affect the rest of the heap’s behavior. Good luck!</p>

#
### **Task Instructions:**
Your task is to implement a novel data structure - your project lead is calling it a power of two max heap. The rest of your team is doing their best to come up with a better name. 

#### **The requirements of the data structure are as follows:**
- The heap must satisfy the heap property.
- Every parent node in the heap must have 2^x children.
- The value of x must be a parameter of the heap’s constructor.
- The heap must implement an insert method.
- The heap must implement a pop max method.
- The heap must be implemented in Java.
- The heap must be performant.
- You must use a more descriptive variable name than x in your implementation.

<p>Think carefully about how you implement each method, and manage the underlying data. Performance is critical, so keep cycles and memory usage to a minimum. Be sure to test your heap with very small and very large values of x. As always, keep a weather eye out for sneaky edge cases.</p> 

**Estimated time for task completion: 45-60 minutes, depending on your learning style.**
